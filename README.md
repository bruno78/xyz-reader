## Project Overview

In this project, you will redesign an app to follow the Material Design guidelines and translate 
a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app.

= XYZ Reader Starter Code

This repository stores the starter code for the XYZ Reader project in 
Udacity's Android Nanodegree.


## Why this Project?
This project gives you an opportunity to improve an appâ€™s design, a vital skill for building apps 
users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's 
design as new standards are released.

## What Will I Learn?
Through this project, you will:

* Understand the fundamentals of Android design.
* Apply Material Design guidelines to an mobile application.
* Separate an interface into surfaces.
* Effectively use transitions and motion.
